PasswordGenerator.java: This file contains the core logic for generating random passwords with customizable length and complexity. It implements methods to create passwords using various character sets and rules.

PasswordGeneratorGUI.java: The graphical user interface (GUI) implementation is housed in this file. It provides users with an intuitive interface to interact with the password generation functionality. Users can specify parameters such as password length and complexity preferences through the GUI.

Main.java: Serving as the entry point of the application, this file contains the main method responsible for initiating the program's execution. It may instantiate necessary objects and launch the application's user interface.

App.java: This file represents the main application class. It orchestrates the interaction between different components of the application, manages the GUI initialization, and handles user inputs and actions.

This project aims to provide users with a convenient tool for generating strong and unique passwords, enhancing security practices in digital environments. Developers can contribute to the project by adding features, improving the user interface, or optimizing password generation algorithms. Contributions and feedback are welcomed to make the application more robust and user-friendly.
